## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)

- Supabase account

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/c-ent/Ods.git
cd Ods
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

For Docker Compose, either create a `.env` file with the same values, or pass `.env.local` explicitly with `--env-file .env.local`.

4. Set up Supabase Database:

Create a table called `results` in your Supabase project:
```sql
CREATE TABLE results (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  count INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

-- Insert initial data
INSERT INTO results (category, count) VALUES 
('dream', 0),
('soul', 0),
('adventure', 0);
```

```bash
npm run dev
```
